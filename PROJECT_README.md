    - Creating a Twitter Clone
        * First iteration being an Emoji Twitter Clone
        * Open Source T3 Components
            - Modular and TypeSafe
## Documentation
### PART 1
- (1) Ran create t3-app@latest
- (2) Choose Typescript -> (2a) Select Prisma, Tailwind, trpc
- (3) setup db on planetscale -> vercel deployment
    * `app.planetscale.com` -> `vercel.com`
    1. on prisma, ran `npm install prisma` -> `npx prisma init`
- (4) following the insertion of data into schema.prisma -> ran `npx prisma studio` -> received errors on studio site on example
    * db is not synchronized with current schema as it expects model Example schema in .prisma
- (5) run `npx prisma db push` to update db expectation
- (6) can run `git add -p` allowing for selection of commits to add -> `git push`
- (7) Clerk setup - easy auth management solution
    1. using project name with dashboard (only github login method) -> `npm install @clerk/nextjs`
    2. go to api keys section of clerk and grab api keys
        * next_pub..., clerk_secret...
- (8)  Using Clerk Docs
    * Navigate to Mount <ClerkProvider /> section in clerk docs
        1. this comp wraps app to provide active session, user context to hooks, other comps
        2. add comp in `_app.tsx`
    * add middelware
        * auth every time a server req is made by embedding auth state in req
        1. implemented authmiddleware in `middleware.ts` and added a console.log()
        2. console.log() outputted when starting local host via `npm run dev`
    * after adding middleware -> index.tsx
        1. add block that determines what a user sees depending on signIn state i.e. fundamental auth
        ```tsx
            return(
                ...
                <div>
                {!user.isSignedIn && <SignInButton />}
                {!!user.isSignedIn && <SignOutButton />}
                </div>
            )
        ```
- (9) Implement logging system in order to understand how production is going w/ Axiom
    * had to perform `npm install -g prisma`
    * then went through vercel to add axiom to project
- (10) rewrote schema in schema.prisma, deleted example model and create `post` model -> `npx prisma db push`-> generate new db locally by `npm install`
- (11) coding
    - example.ts
        * change last line to `return ctx.prisma.post.findMany();`
        * may have to restart server
            - ctrl + shift + p -> restart `ts server`
    - index.tsx
        * going to add a line `const {data} = api.posts.getAll.useQuery()` that has now correct type
        * CONSULT TRPC SECTION BELOW
    - created new router for posts `posts.ts`
        * `postsRouter=createTRPCRouter`
        * `ctx.prisma.post.findMany()`
    - root.ts
        * add new key `posts: postsRouter` i.e `router_name: router_nameRouter`
        * get rid of example router as it wasn't being used
    - index.ts
        * we want to use `api.router_name.getAll.useQuery()` with UQ() method in order to obtain data
        * then map that variable to display posts
            - number of posts in an array object that are to be displayed
- (12) can use prisma studio in order to create posts
    * made changes to db -> reset env via `npx prisma studio` -> `npm run dev `
    * added a record via prisma studio -> now can see a post when logging in with github

### PART 2
- change styling using globals.css
    * added a body dictionary that contains `@apply tag` with chosen background, text color
- depending on where you want an effect of structure to take place, need to choose between comps `index.tsx` v `_app.tsx`
- in index.tsx, implementing styling in order to provide twitter look
    * testing <div className='flex flex-col'>
        - added isLoading check, data check
- in order to get imageUrl from user, had to get to user.user
    * user data is nested within user key -> `user.user.imageUrl`
    * fix - in order to get imageUrl to show had to modify `CreatePostWizard` to incorporate `useUser().user`
* get user data from id with single call

### 11/19/23
- performed styling on posts.ts
- on posts.ts changed
    ```js
    post,
    author: users.find((user)=>user.id===post.authorId)
    ```
    to
    ```js
    post,
    author: {
        ...author,
        username:author.username
    }
    // now strict typing as it relates to author?.username - now constrained to type string
    ```
- in order to get spacing between username and time they posted `index.tsx`
    * use a span class following username, `font-thin`
- in order to get accurate dates, `npm install dayjs`

#### TRPC
* allows one to create server functions that run on a server, fetch data in correct shape -> authenticate to user w/o user to directly connect to db
* currently at this point we had an example.ts router
* going to create a posts.ts router


### CI/CD
- Settings of Project: Assumption that Deployment Target is Vercel (gitlab configuration)
- Created yaml file ()
    - Minimal yml workflow file that installs node modules, runs typescript, typechecking, runs lint for repo that uses npm
        - (1) Starts with 'node' Docker image (base image for CI environment)
        - (2) Define stage 'build' to run build commands
        - (3) 'before_script' section runs before each job in pipeline and 'npm install' runs and installs node.js dependencies
        - (4) single build job that runs in build stage
        - (5) commands run in script section
